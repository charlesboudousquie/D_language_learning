First you must know the meaning of a word,
then you need to know what it means given
the current context, 
then follow the organization of said words,
then find antecedents and references
    *antecedent - an event or thing that has happened before
               It could be a phrase(group of words),
               a clause or just a word.
               "The dog is noisy, but we like him."
               "dog" is the Antecedent.
               "him" is pronoun that refers back
               to the "dog". 
               Note: instead of using the word dog again,
                we just use a pronoun (placeholder? pointer?).
                
                There are also implied antecedents:
                   * you and your buddy both spot someone
                   at the same time. You say:
                   "he really is a cool guy".
                   The antecedent is NOT in the sentence,
                   that abstract "guy" is an implied antecedent
                   that you discern from some previous event or
                   conversation. You still used "he" but he in itself
                   does not DIRECTLY correspond to the "guy" 
                   IF you don't have a CONTEXT.
                   Without pronouns or object references to the antecedent,
                   a sentence will become repetitive.
                   CONTEXT allows antecedents to work!
                
then draw inferences(conclusions) about it,
then identify main thought/purpose of sentence,
then be able to answer questions in it,
then recognize literary devices(foreshadow,cliffhangar,backstory),
then determine tone,
then understand the current situation,,
then understand speaker's intent,
then reasses the speaker.

Above mentioned are not necessarily in order.

Sometimes taking too much time understanding one word,
prevents you from understanding the rest of the sentence.

                own thought processes.
